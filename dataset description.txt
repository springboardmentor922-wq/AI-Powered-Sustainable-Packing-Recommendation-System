EcoPackAI – Dataset Description
=====================================================================

Project Overview
----------------
EcoPackAI is an end-to-end data engineering, analytics, and decision-intelligence
project focused on sustainable packaging optimization. The system transforms
historical shipment data and a comprehensive materials master catalog into
actionable insights, recommendations, and sustainability intelligence.

A key challenge addressed is that only ~10 out of ~600 available packaging
materials have been historically used, while the remaining materials represent
prototype, optional, or future-ready alternatives. EcoPackAI bridges this gap
using fuzzy material mapping, feature engineering, and sustainability scoring.

Motto:
Transform historical data into actionable insights across all materials.

Key Objectives:
- Normalize and enrich shipment data with material intelligence
- Compare actual usage vs full materials catalog
- Identify cost- and CO₂-reduction opportunities
- Enable future-facing recommendations for sustainable materials
- Preserve unknowns for informed decision-making instead of discarding them

1. material_id
   - Unique identifier for each packaging material
   - Range: 1 to 602
   - Primary key for material-level analysis

2. material_name
   - Scientific or standardized material name
   - Often longer and more technical
   - Core keywords from this field appear in shipment "packaging_used"

3. category
   - High-level material category
   - Examples: eco-paper, bio-plastic, glass, wood, metal
   - Used for aggregation and category-level insights

4. density_kg_m3
   - Material density in kilograms per cubic meter
   - Important for weight, cost, and CO₂ calculations

5. tensile_strength_MPa
   - Tensile strength in megapascals
   - Proxy for material durability and protection capability

6. cost_per_kg
   - Cost of the material per kilogram
   - Used to calculate packaging cost efficiency

7. co2_emission_kg
   - CO₂ emitted per kilogram of material produced/used
   - Used in environmental impact analysis

8. biodegradable
   - Indicates whether the material is biodegradable
   - Values: YES / NO
   - Key sustainability indicator

---------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Final Enriched Shipment Dataset
----------------------------------
File Name:
final_ecopack_dataset_fe.csv

Role:
Fact dataset representing real shipment orders enriched with material,
environmental, economic, and engineered sustainability features.

Entity:
One row = One shipment/order

Rows:
~15,000

Columns:
27+

Purpose:
- Business intelligence dashboards
- Sustainability analysis
- Recommendation engine training
- Scenario simulation and decision support

---------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE SHIPMENT ATTRIBUTES (FROM HISTORY)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. category
   - Category of the product ordered by the customer
   - Represents shipment/order classification

2. weight_kg
   - Actual physical weight of the shipped item (kg)

3. volumetric_weight_kg
   - Volumetric weight used in logistics pricing
   - Accounts for package size, not just mass

4. item_volume
   - Volume of the shipped item
   - Used to estimate required packaging material quantity

5. fragility
   - Fragility score of the item
   - Scale: 1 (robust) to 10 (highly fragile)

6. moisture_sensitivity
   - Indicates if item is sensitive to moisture
   - Values: TRUE / FALSE

7. shipping_mode
   - Mode of transport
   - Examples: air, road

8. distance_km
   - Distance traveled by the shipment (kilometers)

9. packaging_used
   - Free-text description of packaging used in the shipment
   - Non-normalized and not directly joinable to materials master
   - Used as input for fuzzy matching

10. cost_usd
    - Actual packaging cost incurred for the shipment

11. co2_emission_kg_item
    - CO₂ emissions associated with the shipment and packaging
    - Based on distance, material, and order characteristics

---------------------------------------------------------------------
MATERIAL MAPPING & ENRICHMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

12. material_id
    - Resolved material identifier used to join with materials master
    - Created via fuzzy string matching
    - Ensures MANY shipments map to ONE material

13. material_name
    - Scientific material name from materials master
    - Added after successful mapping

14. category_material
    - Material category from materials master
    - Used for sustainability and cost aggregation

15. density_kg_m3
    - Density of the mapped packaging material

16. tensile_strength_MPa
    - Tensile strength of the mapped material

17. cost_per_kg
    - Cost per kg of the packaging material

18. co2_emission_kg_material
    - CO₂ emitted per kg of packaging material used
    - Scaled based on order volume and weight

19. biodegradable
    - Indicates whether the packaging material is biodegradable
