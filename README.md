## 🚀 The Problem
The e-commerce and logistics sectors contribute significantly to global waste.
* **Over-packaging** leads to unnecessary shipping costs and material waste.
* **Wrong material choices** increase CO₂ emissions and environmental impact.
* Businesses lack **real-time data** to make sustainable decisions instantly.

## 💡 Our Solution: EcoPackAI
EcoPackAI is a lightweight, web-based tool that instantly recommends the optimal packaging material based on:
1.  **Item Category** (Electronics, Food, Fragile, etc.)
2.  **Weight & Distance**
3.  **Fragility Level**

It calculates the **Cost vs. Carbon Footprint** trade-off and compares it against standard plastic packaging to show you exactly how much money and CO₂ you save per shipment.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📦 Smart Recommendation Engine
* Instantly identifies the best sustainable material (e.g., Recycled Cardboard, Mushroom Packaging, Cornstarch Peanuts).
* Considers shipping distance and item weight for accurate impact analysis.

### 📊 Live Analytics Dashboard
* Tracks cumulative **CO₂ saved** and **Cost saved** across all shipments.
* Visualizes material usage trends with interactive **Plotly charts**.
* **Gamified Impact:** Shows "Trees Planted" equivalent to motivate users.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast & Lightweight
* Optimized for performance on edge devices.
* No heavy GPU requirements—runs instantly on any standard server.
* **Zero-Shot Logic:** Uses intelligent keyword mapping for instant categorization without heavy model downloads.

### 📄 Reporting
